I commented the following:

>Thanks for the article Ergest. It reflects well how I think about value.
To part 2, i.e. R&D, I would like to add the terminology “hypothesis testing” in which you might test (weak) relationships in your KPI tree(s) - which you described in terms of finding causal relationships. Together with the organisation’s strategy it should inform what to work on next.
Finally I would not disregard the value of “answering questions”, in case you find value in them. I like to see my colleagues as subject matter experts with good ideas and questions. Also, you can decide whether you deliver them a workable prototype with reduced effort or a production-ready “data product”
